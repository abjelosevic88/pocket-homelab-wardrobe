# Configuration

Environment variables; every one has a default. Personal settings (your style, home town, the laundry, shops, notifications, connections, AI) live in the UI per person — the `OPENAI_*`/`NOTIFY_*` values below are copied once into the first admin's settings.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | – | Where the app is (links in pushes, events and other apps, the OIDC callback) |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | `0.0.0.0` / `8080` | Where it listens |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | The database (photos are inside it) and the Pocket Core token |
| `DB_PATH` | `$DATA_DIR/pocket-wardrobe.db` | The SQLite file |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `local` | `local` (passwords), `proxy` (a header from your reverse proxy), `none` (one user, for trying it out) |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set `true` behind HTTPS |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME` | – | The first account, made on an empty database |

| `NOTIFY_HOUR` | `7` | Default hour of the morning outfit |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | – | AI without Pocket Core |
| `CORE_URL` / `CORE_REGISTRATION_KEY` / `CORE_APP_URL` | – | Pocket Core |
